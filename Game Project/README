Project no: 6

Project due date: May 2nd

Project description: A short game the revolves around keeping your torch alight by lighting other torches. You have a time limit to light the next torch before yours goes out, and you lose. The controls are:
A: move left
D: move right
W: jump
LShift: shoot flare(you only get 5)
Space: Light torch
P: pause
G: god mode
R: restart

The easiest part of this project: Designing the level was easy, as I had done it ahead of time.

Problems that I had in completing this project: I really wanted to incorporate lighting into the game, but whenever I attempted to implement them, the game would severly lag. I ended up putting too much time into trying to get this to work, and ran out of time to implement other pizzazz features, notably sound, or the lights themselves.
